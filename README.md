# CoolParksTool

**A version for the Processing Toolbox in QGIS**

This is the official repository for the CoolParksTool.
It summarizes the results of the research project called CoolParks. 
The user provides park boundaries, type of ground within the park, 
type of canopy within the park and meteorological conditions. 
As output the cooling effect of the park on its surrounding built-up area 
is calculated as well as its impact on building energy consumption and building
 indoor thermal comfort
